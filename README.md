# Diabetes_Prediction_with_ML
Diabetes prediction with Machine Learning involves building a model that can analyze patient data and predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.

ML models learn patterns from historical health data (like Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure,	SkinThickness,	Insulin,	BMI,	DiabetesPedigreeFunction,	Age) and then use those patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.
